# This is the 3rd proyect in Credit Models
* We are going to configure an API for our prediction model

>Introduction:
>First, we clean the data base with the objetive of not making errors while working in a machine learning model
>Second, we use 3 models to predict: the Logistic Regression, Bayesian Ridge, XGBoostRegressor


**Results:**
* We conclued that the Best Model to make our predictions was the 3rd one, XGBoostRegressor with 95% for accuracy
* With this model we making the configuration for our API.
